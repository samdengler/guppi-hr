# GuppiGPT Agent Instructions

## Project Overview

GuppiGPT is a minimal claude.ai style chat: one page, plain text conversation, no
attachments, Google sign-in, and answers grounded in a Bedrock Knowledge Base. The agent
holds nothing between runs and the page starts empty, but three things are kept: the
sign-in session in IndexedDB, one pseudonymous record per thread in S3 for 30 days, and a
vote on a reply as a business event. Chat history in the browser is built behind the
`history` flag and off. The design document (`docs/guppigpt-design.html`) and the decision log
(`docs/guppigpt-decision-log.html`) are the source of truth for architecture; this
repository implements them. `docs/guppigpt-architecture.html` holds the diagrams. When code and design disagree,
fix one of them in the same change.

Guppi is Bob's ship AI from *We Are Legion (We Are Bob)*.

## Tech Stack

- Infrastructure: AWS CDK v2 in Python, one stack `GuppiGpt`, region `us-east-1`
- Agent: Python 3.12, FastAPI, AG-UI over SSE, Strands Agents with the `ag-ui-strands` adapter, arm64 container on AgentCore Runtime
- Model: Claude Haiku 4.5 through the `us.` cross-region inference profile (`MODEL_ID` in the stack)
- Edge: CloudFront in front of an AgentCore Gateway runtime target, plus an `/api/feedback` behavior in front of a small API Gateway REST API that puts reply votes straight onto an EventBridge bus; Cognito user pool federated to Google
- Page: static HTML and vanilla JavaScript in `web/src/`, bundled once by esbuild into `web/dist/` with `@ag-ui/client` as the stream reader, served from S3 through CloudFront
- Package manager: uv workspace (`infra` and `agent` are members)
- Secrets: 1Password CLI at deploy time for the Google OAuth client; the origin header value is generated in Secrets Manager by the stack; nothing secret is checked in

## Rules

- No Lambda functions in the request path or the content sync path by default. Lambda is
  a preference, not a ban: when a function is the right tool, propose it and get Sam's
  approval before building it. Approved so far: the Lambda functions inside Dynatrace's
  own AWS activation stack (`GuppiGPT-Dynatrace`, 7 Sep 2026), which sits outside
  `GuppiGpt`.
- Secrets never enter files, `cdk.context.json`, or `-c` context values. Values the stack
  cannot produce (the Google OAuth client) are CloudFormation parameters with `no_echo`
  supplied by `scripts/deploy.sh` from 1Password; values it can produce (the
  `X-Origin-Verify` header) live in Secrets Manager and reach the template only as
  dynamic references.
- The agent image installs dependencies from `uv.lock` in a layer before the source is
  copied, so a code change rebuilds only the last layer; `.dockerignore` at the repo root
  limits the build context (and the CDK asset hash) to the agent files and the lockfile.
- Every change to the stack must keep `uv run -- pytest` green and
  `uv run -- cdk synth -c image_uri=<any ecr uri>` working without Docker.
- Prose in docs and comments: no em-dashes or en-dashes, no second person.
- The page renders plain text only: no Markdown parser, no `innerHTML` with model or user text.
- Tests replace `guppi_agent.agent.build_strands_agent`; nothing in `agent/tests` reaches
  Bedrock or the gateway.
- Observability that reads state already reaching the browser is never behind a feature
  flag. `web/features.json` and the OpenFeature provider in `web/src/features.js` mostly
  gate product features (`docs/proposals/feature-flags.md`); the one exception is `rum`,
  since turning it on inserts a script element and starts a vendor library running,
  which is a page behavior change, not a passive read (`docs/proposals/dynatrace.md`).

## Dependency Management

```sh
uv sync --all-packages --dev        # install all workspace members and dev tools
uv add --package guppi-agent httpx  # add a dependency to one member
uv run -- pytest                    # run all tests
uv run -- pytest agent/tests -v
uv run -- ruff check .
cd web && npm ci && npm run build   # bundle the page into web/dist/
cd web && npm test                  # node:test coverage for the feature flag overlay and the copy wording
```

Flipping a feature flag: edit `web/features.json`, then run `scripts/deploy.sh --site-only`
to rebuild the page and republish `web/dist/config.json` with the new defaults; no `cdk
deploy` and no CloudFormation parameter (`docs/proposals/feature-flags.md`).

- Always use `uv add --package <member>` for dependencies, not manual pyproject edits.
- Run `uv sync --all-packages --dev` after pulling changes.

## Deploying

`scripts/deploy.sh` reads the Google OAuth client id and secret from 1Password
(`op://Personal/GuppiGPT Google OAuth/...`, an API Credential item whose `username` is the client id and `credential` is the client secret), runs `cdk deploy` with them as parameters,
builds the page (`npm ci`, `npm run build` in `web/`), writes `web/dist/config.json` from the stack outputs, syncs `web/dist/` to the site bucket, and
invalidates CloudFront. When the 1Password read fails the script omits both parameters and
CloudFormation reuses the stack's existing values. `GUPPI_ALARM_EMAIL`, when set, becomes
the `AlarmEmail` parameter and subscribes that address to the alarm topic.
`GUPPI_INVESTIGATOR_ARN`, when set, becomes the `InvestigatorPrincipalArn` parameter and
narrows the conversation investigator role's trust to that one ARN; left unset, the role
trusts the account root. `scripts/deploy.sh --site-only` skips `cdk deploy` (so no image build or push) and
publishes the page from the last outputs file. Every run is
also written to `.deploy/deploy-<timestamp>.log` with `.deploy/latest.log` pointing at the
newest and a final `deploy exit=<code>` line, so a Claude session can watch a deploy
started from any terminal. Deploys run on Sam's Mac; the Docker image is built there for
arm64.

The runtime's request header allowlist names `Authorization` and `traceparent`; without
the first the runtime validates the bearer and drops it, and the agent has no token for
the tools gateway; without the second the trace the page started ends at the runtime.
The edge gateway target's allowed request headers name the session id header and
`traceparent` for the same reason. The runtime container receives `TOOLS_GATEWAY_URL`,
`MODEL_ID`, `RETRIEVE_TOOL`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `OTEL_PYTHON_EXCLUDED_URLS`,
`CONVERSATION_LOG_ENABLED`, `CONVERSATION_LOG_BUCKET`, and `CONVERSATION_LOG_KEY_SECRET_ARN`
from the stack; the container starts under `opentelemetry-instrument` (`agent/Dockerfile`), and the
runtime supplies the ADOT exporter settings itself. `docs/proposals/traceability.md`
describes the identifiers and where each one is logged.

Conversation logging (`docs/proposals/conversation-logging.md`) ships behind two switches,
both off. `CONVERSATION_LOG_ENABLED` in `stack.py` decides whether the agent writes one
record per thread to the conversation log bucket, uses the keyed pseudonym on the run line,
and tells the model that conversations are logged; `"logging"` in `web/features.json`
decides whether the page's hint and empty state say so. Flip the runtime switch and deploy
first, then the page switch, so the page never promises a record that does not exist; turn
them off in the other order. The bucket, the KMS key, the HMAC secret, and the investigator
role are created either way, so flipping a switch is one line and a deploy.

The stack also owns one account-wide setting, CloudWatch Transaction Search (the span
destination and a 1 percent indexing rule), because the instrumented container's spans
are refused until it is on. The web ACL on the edge gateway keeps all three rules in COUNT
until `WAF_BLOCK` in `stack.py` is flipped after real traffic has been watched. The billing
alarm reads `AWS/Billing EstimatedCharges`, which exists only after billing alerts are
enabled in the account's billing preferences (a console setting, not in the stack). The two
gateways' and the runtime's `APPLICATION_LOGS` (and, for the gateways, `TRACES`) are
delivered to CloudWatch Logs groups under `/aws/vendedlogs/bedrock-agentcore/`, 30 day
retention, alongside alarms on gateway 4xx rate and 5xx count, runtime 5xx count and p90
latency, and Bedrock throttling, all notifying the alarm topic (`docs/proposals/operations.md`).

Dynatrace is shipped dark: `DynatraceBeaconOrigin`, `DynatraceOtlpEndpoint`, and
`DynatraceApiToken` are stack parameters that default empty, so the CSP and the runtime's
trace export env vars render exactly as they do today until Sam supplies real values.
`scripts/deploy.sh` reads the OTLP endpoint and the API token from 1Password
(`op://Personal/GuppiGPT Dynatrace/...`, an API Credential item whose `hostname` is the
endpoint and `credential` is the token) the same way it reads the Google OAuth client,
skipping them when the item does not exist yet; `GUPPI_DYNATRACE_BEACON_ORIGIN`, when
set, becomes the `DynatraceBeaconOrigin` parameter the same way `GUPPI_ALARM_EMAIL`
becomes `AlarmEmail`. The RUM script itself (`web/vendor/ruxitagentjs.js`, gitignored) is
copied into the bundle at `/dt/ruxitagentjs.js` before the sync when present. Turning RUM
on for visitors is still the `rum` flag in `web/features.json`, flipped the same way as
`history` and `feedback`. Reusing the OTLP parameters above, a Firehose stream forwards
the vended logs to Dynatrace, dark until Sam supplies real OTLP values.
`docs/proposals/dynatrace.md` has the full flip procedure and what Sam has to create in
Dynatrace first.

Reply votes take their own path, off the chat runtime and off the trace
(`docs/proposals/feedback.md`). The page posts one to `/api/feedback`, a CloudFront
behavior listed ahead of `/api/*` because behaviors are matched in the order they appear;
behind it, an API Gateway REST API validates the body, checks the same Cognito token
(naming the `openid` scope, without which the authorizer refuses the page's access token),
and integrates directly with `events:PutEvents` on the `guppi-gpt-feedback` bus. A 30 day
archive on the bus keeps every vote; the rule that forwards them to Dynatrace as business
events turns on with the same two parameters as log forwarding. The `feedback` flag in
`web/features.json` is what puts the control on the page, and it is off.

The knowledge base corpus is refreshed by `scripts/seed-content.sh` (three docs repositories
at revisions pinned in the script, Markdown only, `aws s3 sync --delete` to `docs/<source>/`
in the content bucket) followed by `scripts/ingest.sh`. A scheduler runs the same ingestion
nightly. The tools gateway target is named `docs`, so the MCP tools are `docs___Retrieve` and
`docs___AgenticRetrieveStream`.

Two context keys exist for experiments and default off: `-c bind_runtime_to_gateway=true`
adds `allowedWorkloadConfiguration` to the runtime authorizer, and
`-c target_credentials=GATEWAY_IAM_ROLE` makes the gateway sign requests to the runtime
instead of passing the user token through. Neither works against the deployed JWT runtime
today; the decision log records why.
