// Dynatrace RUM on the page, dark behind the `rum` flag (web/features.json). Nothing in
// this file runs unless isEnabled("rum") and config.rum.scriptPath are both set: no
// script element, no listener, no OpenFeature hook, no network call. See
// docs/proposals/dynatrace.md for the flip procedure and what Sam has to supply first.
//
// The script is self-hosted from the site bucket at config.rum.scriptPath (same origin,
// so the CSP's script-src 'self' does not need to change) and inserted the way a static
// <script src> tag would be. Once it defines window.dtrum, this module:
//   - registers an OpenFeature hook that reports each flag evaluation as a RUM session
//     property (docs/proposals/feature-flags.md, "Attaching Dynatrace later")
//   - optionally calls dtrum.identifyUser with a hashed subject, only when
//     config.rum.identifyUser is true (default false)
//
// Reply votes are not reported here. This module reported each vote as a custom action
// named "reply-feedback" until 5 Sep 2026, when the tenant was found to store nothing
// from the classic JavaScript API's custom actions under its new RUM experience: the
// agent accepted every call and Grail held none of them. A vote now goes to the feedback
// API as a business event instead (docs/proposals/feedback.md).
//
// The dtrum methods used here (sendSessionProperties, identifyUser) are confirmed
// against Dynatrace's published
// TypeScript declarations, @dynatrace/dtrum-api-types
// (https://unpkg.com/@dynatrace/dtrum-api-types/dtrum.d.ts); the prose page named in the
// task, docs.dynatrace.com's RUM JavaScript API reference, 404s as of 3 Sep 2026, and
// its shortlink resolves to a different page (the RUM configuration REST API, not the
// browser dtrum object). The type declarations are the same API surface Dynatrace's own
// examples use, so the method names and argument shapes below are not a guess.
