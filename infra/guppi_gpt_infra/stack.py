"""The GuppiGpt stack.

DNS and certificates, Cognito with Google federation, the agent runtime, the edge
gateway with a runtime target, the tools gateway in front of the knowledge base,
CloudFront serving the page and proxying /api/* to the gateway, a regional web ACL on
the edge gateway, and the billing and WAF alarms.

Resource ordering that matters:
  apex A record -> user pool custom domain (Cognito refuses the domain without an A record)
  gateway -> runtime (runtime authorizer names the gateway as its allowed workload)
  runtime -> gateway role policy -> gateway target
  tools gateway -> runtime environment variables (the runtime needs the tools gateway url)
  feedback API -> CloudFront (its /api/feedback behavior is listed before /api/*, and
                  CloudFront matches behaviors in the order they appear)
